**Astra AI-Driven Productivity & Project Management Assistant** ✨🧠🔧

You are tasked with building **Astra**, a fully functional, commercial-ready voice assistant application, which will be delivered in two distinct editions tailored to different user bases: **Single-Edition** designed for individual users and personal productivity, and **Industry Edition** developed for organizational use with more advanced administrative and collaborative capabilities. Astra must operate as a local home server hosted on Windows, fully encapsulated within a one-click executable installer using Inno Setup, and must include all necessary dependencies such as `.dll` libraries. Additionally, an Android companion app must be available to allow mobile users to connect seamlessly to their local Astra server. 🛠️🖥️📱

This system is to be built entirely with real, tested, and modular code. The architecture should avoid placeholder or mock logic, favoring tested implementations suitable for commercial-grade applications. Whenever possible, Astra should default to using freely available, offline-capable AI models or services to ensure longevity and independence. If needed, access to online services can be made configurable through `.env` files that hold API credentials, but no service should require mandatory online connectivity. 🤖🔌🔐

**Business Model & Licensing:** 💼📊🔐

- **Single-Edition (Personal):** This edition is offered for free to a single user, making it ideal for hobbyists, students, or productivity-focused individuals. However, if users want to expand access to additional members (e.g., family or coworkers), they can purchase five-user access packs at \$100 each, stackable up to an appropriate limit. This edition includes all core features but lacks enterprise-level control and team collaboration tools.

- **Industry Edition (Enterprise):** A robust, fully commercial offering built for businesses, educational institutions, or teams requiring structured access and centralized control. All users must be licensed, either on a per-user basis or through an organizational license. This edition includes features such as user accounts, secure authentication, role-based permission controls, shared knowledge bases, audit logging, admin dashboards, and more. Team collaboration tools and compliance-level privacy features are exclusive to this version. 🏢🔐📈

**Core Requirements:** 📋🧩🔍

1. **Offline-First Architecture:** Astra must prioritize using offline models first for all AI tasks, including voice recognition (e.g., Vosk), text-to-speech (e.g., Piper), summarization, translation, and document processing. If online access is available and user-approved, APIs such as DeepSeek, OpenRouter, LibreTranslate, and OpenWeatherMap can be used to supplement or replace local models. This dual-mode design ensures Astra remains functional without constant internet access.
2. **Modular & Scalable:** Every feature module should be separately loadable and toggleable from the settings panel. Plugins should follow a sandboxed architecture to ensure security, with a built-in plugin manager for downloading, activating, and updating modules. Advanced users can enable CLI access for automation.
3. **Cross-Platform Delivery:** Astra must be packaged for Windows using Inno Setup as a single-click installer. For mobile users, a standalone APK or AAB package must allow full-featured Android access. A Linux AppImage should be optionally supported. Plugin updates should be available via over-the-air mechanisms.
4. **Security & Privacy:** Security is paramount. All local data must be encrypted with AES-256, and network communication should use TLS 1.3. Role-based authentication is required for the Industry Edition, along with a full-featured privacy dashboard, voice biometric recognition, and export/delete functionality for users’ data. LAN sync and team data access must be secured and permission-based. 🔒🛡️📊

**Technical Stack:** 🧪💻🗂️

- **Backend:** Built with Python using FastAPI (or Flask) for the server logic. All asynchronous operations should leverage asyncio for scalability. Integration with ML libraries such as PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, TensorFlow Lite, or ONNX runtime should be modular. Expose APIs as REST or WebSocket endpoints to support different types of client interaction.
- **Frontend:** Developed using Flutter with Material 3 support to deliver a sleek, modern UI. Must be responsive across desktop and mobile platforms. Include gesture navigation, dynamic theming, and advanced accessibility features such as screen reader compatibility, contrast modes, and support for customized wake words.
- **ASR/ASR Fallback:** Vosk will serve as the offline ASR engine. DeepSeek ASR integration via OpenRouter is to be available as an optional online enhancement. Audio pipeline should be configurable for noise suppression.
- **NLU & Summarization:** Local summarization powered by simplified transformers or rules must exist as fallback. DeepSeek summarization and classification tools may be leveraged when online. Intent and context understanding should support user correction and chaining.
- **TTS:** Piper should be the core TTS system with multiple voice options. Python CLI wrappers must expose pitch, rate, and emotion control for varied output.
- **Database & Sync:** Use `sqlcipher`-encrypted SQLite for data storage. Document and user content should support LAN or cloud-based CRDT sync using Python-integrated Automerge libraries. Enable service discovery using mDNS or similar protocols.
- **Cache & Performance:** Implement LRU caches for repeated queries, quantized model loading, preloaded interpreters for cold start improvement, and tree-shaking to reduce final build sizes. 🧠🚀📦

**Feature Modules (select highlights; toggle per edition):** 📚🧠⚙️

- **Productivity & Project Management:** Advanced modules must include predictive deadlines, real-time project health monitoring, and risk alerts. Task recommendations and intelligent sorting should be based on historical patterns and behavior. Integration with external tools (e.g., calendar apps) should enable seamless scheduling. Gantt chart visualizations must be generated on demand.
- **Communication & Collaboration:** Features such as AI-generated meeting summaries, action point extraction, shared notes, and smart email triage must be included. LAN voice messaging and chat translation should support hybrid and local team communication.
- **Knowledge & Summaries:** Astra must be able to extract and summarize content from PDFs, DOCX, websites, and scanned images. Semantic search should use embeddings for accurate Q&A over user content.
- **Personalization & Analytics:** Adaptive tone based on user sentiment, mistake-aware learning mode, behavioral analytics dashboards, and mood- or location-based notification timing must be offered to personalize the assistant.
- **Health & Lifestyle:** Routine tracking, hydration prompts, and posture reminders, synced with fitness devices like Google Fit or Apple Health, should be available with voice query support. Breathing exercises and mindfulness sessions must be built-in.
- **Home Automation & IoT:** Integration with MQTT, Home Assistant, and other open protocols should allow discovery and control of smart lights, thermostats, and switches. LAN-based control and automation routines must be configurable by voice.
- **Security & Privacy Controls:** Offer granular access logging, parental restriction profiles, and scheduled do-not-disturb settings. Provide voice command logs for review, export, or deletion.
- **Accessibility & Engagement:** Features should include experimental ASL detection, customizable wake words, and voice-triggered creativity tools such as image generation or quizzes.
- **Developer & Power Tools:** Provide CLI access, local REST API, plugin development SDKs, telemetry logs (optional), crash reports, and debugging tools for developers. 🧑‍💻🔬📈

**Packaging & Deployment:** 📦🚀🧩

- **Windows:** Use Inno Setup to bundle all components into a single installer, including Python runtime, models, frontend binaries, and dependencies.
- **Android:** Provide a native APK that discovers the local Astra server over LAN. Include background services for continuous listening if permitted.
- **Updates:** Updates for modules and plugins should be fetched securely via HTTPS. LAN devices should be able to share updates over the network for convenience. 🔄🌐🛠️

**Performance Metrics:** 📈⚡🧠

- **Wake-word latency:** <200 ms
- **ASR accuracy offline:** >95%
- **TTS MOS:** ≥4.5
- **Cold start:** <1.5 s
- **Sync latency (LAN):** <100 ms
- **Memory footprint (baseline):** <500 MB

**Development Roadmap:** 🛤️🧪🧱

1. Build initial Python backend server with ASR and TTS.
2. Develop MVP Flutter frontend and implement API connectivity.
3. Set up local CRDT syncing and server discovery features.
4. Add modules for meeting summaries and document summarization.
5. Implement full enterprise login and user role system.
6. Launch plugin marketplace and CLI tools.
7. Perform performance optimization, benchmarking, and security audits.
